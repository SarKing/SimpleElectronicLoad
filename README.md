## Schematic

## Function Principle

The main part of the circuit is the U1A OpAmp. In this configuration it operates like a error amplifier. 
The voltage feedback from the shunt resistor (R11) gets compared with votlage setted by the user using RV2 and 
by OpAmp effect the output changes until both voltages are the same (in theory).    

The equation for the current is:
